CSAT Prediction Using Logistic Regression
This project focuses on predicting Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) scores using supervised machine learning techniques. The objective is to help the business understand which factors influence customer satisfaction and proactively improve service quality.

Project Goals:
Clean and preprocess real-world customer service data

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and extract meaningful insights

Engineer features such as response time, handling time, and categorical encodings

Train a Logistic Regression model to classify CSAT scores

Evaluate the model using accuracy and classification metrics

Visualize trends across product categories, agent shifts, and customer behavior

Identify actionable insights that drive customer experience
